		<p class=story-hero>Text-messaging interventions are uniquely suited for underserved populations. A growing body of literature has validated the efficacy of text-based health interventions to 1) increase medication adherence, 2) enhance health literacy, and 3) improve appointment attendance. <a href="#mobile-story"><span class=serif-ital>Continue Reading &#8250;</span></a></p>

<p class=story>Healthcare is at a tipping point. Unprecedented efforts are being made to improve health outcomes and foster efficiency in healthcare delivery. What seems promising with the current reform and transformation efforts is the convergence of existing mass markets influencing healthcare innovation. Mobile phones now allow providers to monitor and engage patients, encouraging healthy lifestyle behaviors and foster self-health management. Mobile text messaging communication in particular has proven to be an effective way to foster desired behavior change in patients and improve the way in which care is delivered by capturing important and actionable data. </p>

<p class=story>Health coverage expansion enacted by the Affordable Care Act demands improved patient outcomes and efficient delivery of care to millions of Americans entering the system, utilizing more healthcare resources. In particular, Medicaid expansion is projected to result in a total of 75.6 million enrollees for 2014, an increase of roughly 19.5 million as a result of the ACA. Mobile text message communication facilitates convenient and efficient communication among patients and providers and encourages healthy behavior changes by providing patients with educational tools to improve health outcomes, achieving the triple-aim objective of healthcare reform.</p>

<p class=story>CareMessage aims to change health care delivery for disadvantaged populations by pioneering the effort of mobile technology, improving access to critical health information and effective self-care management. A June 2013 Pew Research report estimated mobile phone penetration rate at 86% among American households earning less than $30,000 per year. This compares to 59% of the same demographic who have access to a desktop or laptop and 47% who have broadband set-up at home. These figures imply a greater potential of mobile health innovations to accelerate adoption compared to other technological approaches for this demographic.</p>

<p class=story>The opportunities to innovate using mobile technologies among the low-income and underserved populations are robust. A review of several research publications as well as a survey of key constituents within the healthcare ecosystem serving these populations show that the unmet needs plaguing the healthcare safety-net population is contributing to waste of resources in the form of  poor appointment attendance, poor medication adherence, and poor health literacy. [make 1 paragraph] Patient engagement strategies deploying text messaging have the potential to reduce waste and inefficiencies in the system by improving health literacy and self-health management of low-income and underserved populations. This paper intends to review studies and analyze the implications of using text messaging as a way to encourage patient behavior change. </p>

<h2 class=story-heading>SMS for Appointment Reminders</h2>

<p class=story>Patients who fail to attend their scheduled doctor visits contribute to inefficiencies and misused resources. In general, it is found that a reminder, whether it be by text or phone, is helpful in improving attendance. However, SMS technology is a more cost-effective approach. </p>

<p class=story>A 2012 study analyzing the effect of SMS text reminders to reduce non-attendance for hospital outpatient visits found a significant difference in the attendance rate of patients who received a text reminder compared to patients who received no reminder. The study was conducted at ITS-CDSR in the Departments of Prosthodontics, Endodontics, Orthodontics and Paedodontics through the Department of Public Health and Dentistry in India. Patients who had a mobile phone number on record were enrolled in the text message reminders, totaling 206 participants compared to 110 in the control group (patients receiving no reminder). The study was conducted across different departments for a period of 4 months. The results indicated that the attendance rate for patients who received text message reminders over the 4 month period were significantly higher (79.2%) compared to the attendance rate of those who received no reminder (35.5%).</p>

<h2 class=story-heading>SMS for Medication Reminders</h2>

<p class=story>Patients’ failure to adhere to their medication regimen can lead to unnecessary disease progression and complications. This contributes to waste in the healthcare system by increasing preventable visits to the emergency room and increased utilization of other healthcare resources. Researchers have evaluated the impact of SMS text reminders on promoting medication adherence. The results are promising, suggesting text as an efficient and effective way to ensure patients take their medication.</p>

<p class=story>The American Heart Association also found that text message reminders improved the medication adherence of patients who were recovering from a heart attack. The study included 90 patients over a 30 day period. The patients were divided into three groups: one received two medication reminders daily along with educational tips, the second group received only educational tips, and the third group received no messages at all. The results show that the group who received both reminders and tips had an 88% rate of correct prescription adherence compared to 72% of [delete the] patients who received no texts at all. The group who received the heart-health tips had a 95% rate of adherence.</p>

<h2 class=story-heading>SMS for Education</h2>

<p class=story>SMS text-based education is emerging as an effective way to engage patients in better self-care. Lack of education around basic health information leads to approximately $106 billion to $238 billion in economic burden each year.  Text message outreach with educational content can be an efficient way to improve patients’ health literacy. </p>

<p class=story>The Center for Connected Health in Boston reported in a study that text messaging improved treatment adherence and self-care for dermatology patients suffering from atopic dermatitis. In the study, 25 patients received daily text messages over a period of six weeks. The text messages included treatment reminders and educational content pertaining to their health condition. At the end of the six week study, patients reported an improvement of treatment adherence of 72%. Sixty-eight percent of the patients reported an improvement in self-care behaviors to help their conditions.</p>

<h2 class=story-heading>Conclusion</h2>

<p class=story>Mobile text communication can be a cost-efficient and effective way to engage patients in the desired behavior change to improve appointment attendance, medication adherence, and self-care management of disease. As the healthcare system transitions to a focus on improving health outcomes, engaging patients in the management of their health is critical. SMS text messaging is a low-cost way to facilitate engagement and enhance the health literacy of individuals living with chronic conditions and other health challenges.</p>
